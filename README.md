I created a series of automated tests for three different features on the Sauce Demo website (via https://www.saucedemo.com), each covering various scenarios to ensure the application behaves as expected. All tests were successful with a 100% success rate.

Features and Scenarios:

**1. Login Feature**
    Valid Login Scenario (Positive): Testing with correct username and password to ensure successful login.
    Invalid Login Scenario (Negative): Testing with incorrect username or password to verify error handling and unsuccessful login.
   
**2. Checkout Feature**
    Successful Checkout Scenario (Positive): Testing the complete checkout process with valid inputs to ensure the user can purchase items successfully.
    Unsuccessful Checkout Scenario (Boundaries): Testing the checkout process with boundary values for postal code input to ensure proper validation and error handling.
    
**3. Logout Feature**
    Logout Scenario (Positive): Testing the logout functionality to ensure the user can log out successfully.
